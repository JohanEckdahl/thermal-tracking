# Thermal Tracking of Migratory Bird Flight

This repository contains computer vision code for a collaboration between the CAnMove group of the Lund University Ecology Department and Axis Communications in Lund Sweden. Its purpose is to develop the use of thermal cameras in tracking migratory bird populations. Several proofs of concept using similar techniques have been published [1][2][3] however no study has extended thermal imaging into an in depth biological study. An aim of this project is to update previous work in thermal tracking to use modern, highly portable acquisition hardware as well as widely accessible software such as Python's OpenCV library. Upon successful proof of concept this technique will have the potential to participate in legitimate studies of bird migrations as well as extend its reach into fields such as conservation ecology. This opens an avenue for both the private sector to expand their market as well as for researchers to acquire cheap and portable equipment for acquiring meaningful data.
